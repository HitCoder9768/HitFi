The choice to rename \"HitCoder Target\" to the \"HitFi Target\" comes more from the idea of this being my review preference target, and while it was created by me, it belongs to the HitFi domain. The HitFi neutral target is by no means an objective definitive definition of neutrality, and should not be taken as such. It is instead, more of what I personally consider to sound neutral. If you disagree with it, that's perfectly fine and justifiable, and I don't expect you to agree with it. In fact, I want you to disagree, because if you blindly agree with everything I say, it means you're not making your own decisions. Everything here if just for you to be able to learn my take on things, and that is mostly just to enjoy the hobby and share my opinion with others, to allow for discussion and so that everybody can help each other to learn new things. With all that said and done, allow me to explain the choices made here: Pinna gain peaking at 3k as typical, but anything below slopes in. The emphasis is on 3k, and anything lower is just to enter smoothly into that region, because otherwise, when boosting those frequencies too much between 1kHz up to anything prior to 3kHz leads to bloat, in my opinion. Everything afterwards tapers off as expected. Sub-bass boost on the preference target is to taste. This is not my neutral target, it's my preference target. The bass boost is really the only difference here though. The bass isn't as tight as many might think, it isn't pulled down flat, it's left to gradually taper into the mids. I feel that doing this allows for more warmth, making overall sound fuller. It's not too emphasized as that usually makes for frequency masking (which often is a trade off towards warmth so is normally more preference related. not everyone wants analytical bass and mids.) Compared to other targets it is also much less emphasized; HitFi Neutral is leaner than IEF Neutral and here it is compared to a diffuse field target now, with regards to my preference curve, compared to harman it has much less of an emphasis on the bass and the upper mids, which I personally prefer as it makes the mids feel much fuller. Notably, the new HitFi target has a pinna gain in a very similar location to the Harman target, which I find sounds far cleaner, and less honky and bloated than other targets with a higher gain at around 2kHz. As usual, all targets have a focus around 3kHz, and the HitFi target shows that yet again here. Additionally, the Harman target tends to tighten the mid-bass a lot more than the HitFi preference curve. I find that this tends to sacrifice a lot of warmth, and leaves things sounding a little hollow. Lastly, I'd like to add that through testing and trying this new target, I finally have an explanation for why I enjoy the Moondrop Crescent's upper mids a lot; As shown here, the Crescent follows my target for my upper mids extremely well, while the Aria is a tad more bloated in comparison. That being said, the Aria is definitely still better overall IMHO.","title":"Update to the HitFi target"},{"location":"Blogs/15-10-21/#update-to-the-hitfi-target","text":"Over the past day, and new testing, I've once again decided to update the HitFi preference curve, in addition to introducing a new curve: HitFi Neutral.

It tends to be often recommended by Bad Guy (aka Hawaii Bad Boy), and for good reason; It's a great V-Shaped tuning IEM that can be extremely comfortable for those it fits well with. Many people do not like the texturing and timbre of the bass however, but that's generally up to the individual. Design The design for the BL03 is nothing special, though that's definitely not a bad thing. The cable is nice, looks good, and I really like the L-shaped 3.5mm jack. Though unfortunately the cable is a little on the flimsy side. It's at the very least, however, removable. For this it uses a 2-pin connector much like most other Chinese IEMs. And I actually prefer this to MMCX. The shells of the IEMs themselves are weighty but not overly hefty, making for a nice solid feel without the weight annoyance in your ears. Additionally they look pretty! The housing also seals well which is always appreciated. Overall, thanks to the decent braided cable, the fact it's removable, and the L shaped plug, I can give these a 7/10. Sadly no higher due to the flimsiness of the cable and the fact the ear hooks are a little bit deformed (but still perfectly usable) Tuning As with anything, I'll show a graph for the tuning of the BL03 before I go into detail. The BL03 has a very big bass response. In fact it's one of the most noticeable things about these IEMs; it's overwhelming, to me. It's not bad quality mind you, and could be very fun and enjoyable in a lot of contexts. The lower mids in comparison are slightly recessed, making the bass feel all the more warm and punchy. This results in some very mild bloat but the balance overall is well done. The upper mids hit pretty well tone wise. Vocals sound pleasant and smooth, with sibilant sounds being tame and easy on the ears, while also being mostly clear, and while the tone isn't the best, the representation is overall pleasant and inoffensive despite not being the most accurate. The treble is sparkly, bringing some vibrance and detail to music, though it's a little bit dulled by the big bass response. It's fun sounding, but not extremely detailed. Overall as the BL03 is extremely pleasant, and can be fun to listen to due to the boosted bass and overall v-shaped sound signature I think it deserves a 6/10 overall, with the main caveat being that they're not the most tonally accurate, with slight bass bloat, and lacking detail in the uppermost treble. Value The BL03 is priced around $20, which overall is pretty low, especially with the performance you get in mind. They're not neutral by any means, but they're a very fun and pleasant listen, and probably the best V-shaped sound signature in the price bracket. With this in mind I think the BL03 deserves a 8/10 for its price. Summary Well balanced V-shape with a decent tonality to the upper mids, and though lower mids are a little scooped the BL03 manages to be inoffensive on the ears in the treble making it suitable to most people who want a well-executed V-shaped signature.

Honestly, if it weren't for the fact Moondrop discontinued the Crescent, I would absolutely recommend it to everyone looking for a sub-50 IEMs, regardless of whether they're an audiophile or not. Alas, the world we live in is cruel, and we cannot have nice things. But I digress. Design The Crescent has a very simple traditional bullet-style design, with a very weighty brass(?) housing. Unfortunately, the cable is not removable (though this is supposedly easy to mod, if you're into that), and is not the nicest cable I've ever seen. That being said, it's definitely sturdy, and therefore I cannot fault it for that, aside from personal gripes. I had difficulty getting a good enough seal to keep the Crescent from falling out of my ears over time at first, though gradually as I got more used to them, for whatever reason this problem slowly disappeared. Mysterious. Overall, I think the Crescent has a pretty nice design. It's a little heavier than I would have liked, and I would have also liked removable cables (maybe MMCX connectors), but I know for a fact that it is sturdy and durable. Therefore I will give it's design a 6/10 . Tuning The tuning is where the Crescent really shines. The bass is quite warm, somewhat reminiscent of the Sony MH755 and allegedly the Sony MH1C (though I cannot confirm this). With a little more emphasis on the sub-bass, the Crescent has a lot of sub-bass extension and definitely doesn't lack in that range. The mid-bass is decently pronounced, but tucked away enough to not cause bloat or bleed into the mids. The lower mids are relatively well pronounced, in the way that they are not recessed or scooped, resulting in more of a \"neutral with bass boost\" kind of sound as opposed to the common slew of V-shaped tuning. The upper mids are present, and tonally accurate, with vocals sounding very smooth and velvety, and most instruments occupying this range sound very tonally accurate. The treble seems to not extend very far, but that's fine for a sub-50 IEM. There's definitely enough sparkle in the upper regions to make music enjoyable, but there may be a noticeable lack of \"air\" Lots of people have been calling the tuning of the Crescent \"Harman\", but I personally don't find it to be as harsh (or \"shouty\") in the upper midrange as typical harman-tuned IEMs. I'd personally consider the Crescent to be \"neutral with bass boost\", and that's extremely appealing to me. With such a pleasant tonality, and inoffensive tuning in the treble, and enough of a bass response to add warmth and depth to every song without it taking the spotlight, I have to give the Crescent a 6/10 tuning-wise. Value Unfortunately, the Moondrop Crescent is discontinued. But to keep things consistent, I'll value-rate it based on it's original price of $30 - which is a VERY good price. I'd argue that the Crescent was the best option in the price range, though arguably the bass boost isn't for everybody. Therefore, I'll give it an 8/10 Summary The Moondrop Crescent.

Score: 66","title":"Summary"},{"location":"IEMs/moondrop-aria/","text":"Moondrop Aria Intro The Moondrop Aria is somewhat new to Moondrop's line of high-performance budget single-DD IEMs. Allegedly it's a lot like it's bigger brothers, the Moondrop Starfield and the Moondrop KXXS, except with a lower price tag, worse imaging, and a supposedly better soundstage. However, measuring and judging such characteristics are not my forte, so I'll go into it as best I can where it's relevant, but I'll stick to what I do know. I'd also like to note that the Aria is often regarded as inferior at the price point to the ER2SE / ER2XR, so do keep that in mind. Design The Aria comes with a very nice braided cable with a nylon-braided surface. I really do like the feel and appearance, and it indeed makes them feel very elegant and premium. Additionally the cable uses a 2-pin connector and is replaceable, which is largely appreciated, notably because I do generally prefer the 2-pin connector to MMCX connectors as they take much longer to wear out and do not twist. Lastly, the cable terminates with an L-shaped 3.5mm jack, which is additionally appreciated as I find this to be more practical for portable use. The shells for the Aria are very weighty and have a metal finish, making them feel sturdy and robust. Though, with that being said I don't find the weight to be the most comfortable ever, and in addition the nozzles are a little on the large size, which makes getting a good seal slightly annoying for me (weirdly I only really have issues in my left ear). They also look really nice too, with a similar pattern on the shell to that of the pattern on the box. In the box along with the Arias were also a bunch of ear tips- I'd argue that there were a little too many, which while many people would appreciate, I found it hard to tell the difference between the sizes. I settled on the medium-ish sized tips but I digress. Lastly, the box for the Moondrop Aria also included a carry case, which is extremely appreciated as I always like to keep my IEMs in cases to keep them safe and transport them without getting damaged and with reduced chances of tangling. Overall, the cable is great, the build is sturdy and premium, and the case included is very very nice, though I did find the shells to be a little heavy for my liking, and the sheer quantity of tips overwhelmed me a little bit. Thus, I'd have to give the Aria a 7/10 for its design. Tuning As usual I will drop the graph here to get you acquainted with the objective side of the tuning before I begin. The Moondrop Aria hits my bass preference pretty well, with a boost at 30Hz of about 7db from the lower mids around 600Hz. The midbass between 100Hz and 300Hz is a little boosted for my preference, making the bass a little \"smeary\" as described by a few people in the Dankpods Discord server. With that being said, the quality of the bass is perfectly fine, especially for the price point, and I find it to be quite pleasant sounding. It may be \"smeary\" but it is not bloated, and doesn't muddy up any of the other frequencies. The lower mids are fine; slightly recessed, but not noticeably so. The result feels more \"bass-boosted neutral\" than \"V-Shaped\". The upper mids are extremely smooth,and again, hit my target curve pretty well. The Aria is a little louder at around 2kHz than my target, but this doesn't seem to present an issue, and is overall very pleasant to my ears. There is no harshness or sibilance on vocals, and the tonality is extremely pleasant. The treble is also very pleasant and easy on the ears; there is no noticeable pierce, and there's a reasonable amount of airiness, though it doesn't extend as far as I would like. In conclusion, the tuning is very pleasant. It hits my preference target pretty well with a few minor nitpicks. Though because of the smeary bass, and the mids being just a smidge more recessed than I'd like (and when I say a smidge, I really do mean a very small amount), the 2kHz band not quite being where I want it to be, and the treble not extending as far as I would like, I'm going to have to give the Aria a solid 8/10 for its tuning. Value The Aria, at ~$70USD is a little more expensive than everything else I have tried thus far, as far as IEMs go at least, but it is definitely deserving of its price tag.

However, measuring and judging such characteristics are not my forte, so I'll go into it as best I can where it's relevant, but I'll stick to what I do know. I'd also like to note that the Aria is often regarded as inferior at the price point to the ER2SE / ER2XR, so do keep that in mind.","title":"Intro"},{"location":"IEMs/moondrop-aria/#design","text":"The Aria comes with a very nice braided cable with a nylon-braided surface. I really do like the feel and appearance, and it indeed makes them feel very elegant and premium. Additionally the cable uses a 2-pin connector and is replaceable, which is largely appreciated, notably because I do generally prefer the 2-pin connector to MMCX connectors as they take much longer to wear out and do not twist. Lastly, the cable terminates with an L-shaped 3.5mm jack, which is additionally appreciated as I find this to be more practical for portable use. The shells for the Aria are very weighty and have a metal finish, making them feel sturdy and robust. Though, with that being said I don't find the weight to be the most comfortable ever, and in addition the nozzles are a little on the large size, which makes getting a good seal slightly annoying for me (weirdly I only really have issues in my left ear). They also look really nice too, with a similar pattern on the shell to that of the pattern on the box. In the box along with the Arias were also a bunch of ear tips- I'd argue that there were a little too many, which while many people would appreciate, I found it hard to tell the difference between the sizes. I settled on the medium-ish sized tips but I digress. Lastly, the box for the Moondrop Aria also included a carry case, which is extremely appreciated as I always like to keep my IEMs in cases to keep them safe and transport them without getting damaged and with reduced chances of tangling. Overall, the cable is great, the build is sturdy and premium, and the case included is very very nice, though I did find the shells to be a little heavy for my liking, and the sheer quantity of tips overwhelmed me a little bit. Thus, I'd have to give the Aria a 7/10 for its design.","title":"Design"},{"location":"IEMs/moondrop-aria/#tuning","text":"As usual I will drop the graph here to get you acquainted with the objective side of the tuning before I begin. The Moondrop Aria hits my bass preference pretty well, with a boost at 30Hz of about 7db from the lower mids around 600Hz. The midbass between 100Hz and 300Hz is a little boosted for my preference, making the bass a little \"smeary\" as described by a few people in the Dankpods Discord server. With that being said, the quality of the bass is perfectly fine, especially for the price point, and I find it to be quite pleasant sounding. It may be \"smeary\" but it is not bloated, and doesn't muddy up any of the other frequencies. The lower mids are fine; slightly recessed, but not noticeably so. The result feels more \"bass-boosted neutral\" than \"V-Shaped\". The upper mids are extremely smooth,and again, hit my target curve pretty well. The Aria is a little louder at around 2kHz than my target, but this doesn't seem to present an issue, and is overall very pleasant to my ears. There is no harshness or sibilance on vocals, and the tonality is extremely pleasant. The treble is also very pleasant and easy on the ears; there is no noticeable pierce, and there's a reasonable amount of airiness, though it doesn't extend as far as I would like. In conclusion, the tuning is very pleasant. It hits my preference target pretty well with a few minor nitpicks. Though because of the smeary bass, and the mids being just a smidge more recessed than I'd like (and when I say a smidge, I really do mean a very small amount), the 2kHz band not quite being where I want it to be, and the treble not extending as far as I would like, I'm going to have to give the Aria a solid 8/10 for its tuning.","title":"Tuning"},{"location":"IEMs/moondrop-aria/#value","text":"The Aria, at ~$70USD is a little more expensive than everything else I have tried thus far, as far as IEMs go at least, but it is definitely deserving of its price tag.

That's not a bad thing, but I would not call these reference monitors, and anybody who had formerly called these \"neutral\" probably needs to do a little more research. Unfortunately, all of the credible things about the DT6 fall flat once you finally get to the dreaded upper mids . Oh dear. Unfortunately, I have to say that Crinacle was right. The tonality is completely thrown out of whack by the consistent indecisiveness of the upper mids.

Other things are thrown off terribly too, such as vocals. If you'd like an idea of how the Senfer DT6 sounds with regards to vocals, just imagine in every song, the vocallists are singing with face masks on.

It manages to impress me even now, with how neutral and inoffensive it sounds, surpassing my expectations once again. Though, sadly the T2 Plus is not to my tastes enough for me to be able to use it regularly. Design The design is (in my humble opinion) much improved from the original T2's, with a more rounded and smooth feeling housing, which seems to sit better in my ears, and seal better too. The cable provided is also much thicker and sturdier than the original, though still uses the usual MMCX connectors. The cable also includes pre-moulded ear hooks, which for this kind of design I very much appreciate having. The housing of the T2 Plus is also heavier than the original, but not to any unpleasant extent, and can be comfortable in my ears for long periods of time. As the housing is comfortable and seals well, and the cable provided is good, I'm happy to give these a 7/10 . Improvements would mostly consist of a more tightly braided cable and maybe an L-shaped jack or something, but the latter is more down to preference. Tuning The tuning of the T2 Plus is, as expected, very neutral sounding. The sub-bass does not extend as far as I would like, but that's more of a personal gripe than anything. The mids sound great on these, and the upper mids are tuned very pleasantly, seeming to be very natural and accurate sounding. The treble doesn't extend the furthest, but is decent enough to make the T2 Plus moderately exciting to listen to, with some extra detail brought to the forefront over other contenders in the same budget range. Strangely enough, these are not all that similar to the original T2. The bass extension seems to go a tad further than the original, with more emphasis on the midbass than the low mids where the original T2 seemingly tackles this the other way around. In addition, the upper mids feel a little more accurate on the T2 Plus, with more balance. The treble is also a little tamer on the T2 Plus, with a lower amplitude above 7kHz, and less extension overall. Overall, well tuned, moslty tonally accurate, and a good balance between detail and comfortable listening, though can be mildly cold sounding at times. 7/10 Value The T2 Plus is priced at around $60, which is a little above the majority of things presented here thus far. That being said, it performs well in the price bracket, probably being one of the most tonally accurate you can find, and having better detailing than a lot of alternatives. Additionally, it is one of the best of its kind in the sub-200 price bracket, being pretty close to neutral (if with a slightly warm tilt), which is uncommon in this budget range. Thus, I give the T2 Plus an 8/10 in value, simply for being the best of its kind you can get for the price, and still maintaining that achievement a little upwards of that. Summary Pleasantly tuned and neutral sounding, the tonality is almost spot on, aside from some bloat in the upper mids. Not for everyone, can be percieved as cold/anemic.

It manages to impress me even now, with how neutral and inoffensive it sounds, surpassing my expectations once again. Though, sadly the T2 Plus is not to my tastes enough for me to be able to use it regularly.","title":"Intro"},{"location":"IEMs/tin-t2-plus/#design","text":"The design is (in my humble opinion) much improved from the original T2's, with a more rounded and smooth feeling housing, which seems to sit better in my ears, and seal better too. The cable provided is also much thicker and sturdier than the original, though still uses the usual MMCX connectors. The cable also includes pre-moulded ear hooks, which for this kind of design I very much appreciate having. The housing of the T2 Plus is also heavier than the original, but not to any unpleasant extent, and can be comfortable in my ears for long periods of time. As the housing is comfortable and seals well, and the cable provided is good, I'm happy to give these a 7/10 . Improvements would mostly consist of a more tightly braided cable and maybe an L-shaped jack or something, but the latter is more down to preference.","title":"Design"},{"location":"IEMs/tin-t2-plus/#tuning","text":"The tuning of the T2 Plus is, as expected, very neutral sounding. The sub-bass does not extend as far as I would like, but that's more of a personal gripe than anything. The mids sound great on these, and the upper mids are tuned very pleasantly, seeming to be very natural and accurate sounding. The treble doesn't extend the furthest, but is decent enough to make the T2 Plus moderately exciting to listen to, with some extra detail brought to the forefront over other contenders in the same budget range. Strangely enough, these are not all that similar to the original T2. The bass extension seems to go a tad further than the original, with more emphasis on the midbass than the low mids where the original T2 seemingly tackles this the other way around. In addition, the upper mids feel a little more accurate on the T2 Plus, with more balance. The treble is also a little tamer on the T2 Plus, with a lower amplitude above 7kHz, and less extension overall. Overall, well tuned, moslty tonally accurate, and a good balance between detail and comfortable listening, though can be mildly cold sounding at times. 7/10","title":"Tuning"},{"location":"IEMs/tin-t2-plus/#value","text":"The T2 Plus is priced at around $60, which is a little above the majority of things presented here thus far. That being said, it performs well in the price bracket, probably being one of the most tonally accurate you can find, and having better detailing than a lot of alternatives. Additionally, it is one of the best of its kind in the sub-200 price bracket, being pretty close to neutral (if with a slightly warm tilt), which is uncommon in this budget range. Thus, I give the T2 Plus an 8/10 in value, simply for being the best of its kind you can get for the price, and still maintaining that achievement a little upwards of that.","title":"Value"},{"location":"IEMs/tin-t2-plus/#summary","text":"Pleasantly tuned and neutral sounding, the tonality is almost spot on, aside from some bloat in the upper mids.
