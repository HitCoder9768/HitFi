As it has been discontinued for years, many of these float around on Ebay, Amazon, and many similar places. But along with them, so do fakes, making it difficult to recommend them. The MH755 manages to surpass any expectations I had for the price point (I paid \u00a34.99 for my (multiple) pairs). Design I'll start with my personal gripe, the build. Obviously the build quality is nothing special, as expected from such a low price. The housings for the drivers are light, and the cable isn't the best. The worst part of the build here is that the cable is actually too short to use in any conventional way, and as such many people end up modding their MH755 to use MMCX cables. That being said, they're actually designed to be paired with a bluetooth module made by Sony anyway, hence why they're mass-produced and cheap. On the other hand the MH750 is (though lesser available) designed with a longer cable, making it much more usable. Thus I give the design a 5/10 . The MH755 only functional for it's initially declared purpose, and the MH750 being harder to find. Tuning Now onto the sound. The tuning on these is actually particularly pleasant, surprisingly enough. They follow the harman signature relatively closely, with a lot of sub-bass emphasis, and following a bit of a v-shape, scooping some of the lower midrange, and making the upper midrange somewhat shouty, which may be a tad unpleasant to some listeners. The treble extension doesn't go very far either, leaving these as more of a sub-bass powerhouse with clear vocals, and lacking in detail. That being said, they are very natural sounding, and tonally perfectly viable as a daily driver to most people not looking for insane details. In comparison the MH750 is usually slightly more bassy. Though, when comparing the two they are strikingly similar overall. Thus I give the tuning a 6/10. Well balanced, natural, but lacking in detail. Value As I said earlier, the pairs I recieved costed me around \u00a34.99 or similar per pair. That being said, they are discontinued, so it may be hard to get a hold of a genuine pair. Sadly, this means I cannot give these IEMs a value rating, as I cannot guarantee anybody getting a real pair in the first place. Summary A harman-ish IEM, hard to come by nowadays but pleasantly tuned and non-fatiguing.

It manages to impress me even now, with how neutral and inoffensive it sounds, surpassing my expectations once again. Though, sadly the T2 Plus is not to my tastes enough for me to be able to use it regularly. Design The design is (in my humble opinion) much improved from the original T2's, with a more rounded and smooth feeling housing, which seems to sit better in my ears, and seal better too. The cable provided is also much thicker and sturdier than the original, though still uses the usual MMCX connectors. The cable also includes pre-moulded ear hooks, which for this kind of design I very much appreciate having. The housing of the T2 Plus is also heavier than the original, but not to any unpleasant extent, and can be comfortable in my ears for long periods of time. As the housing is comfortable and seals well, and the cable provided is good, I'm happy to give these a 7/10 . Improvements would mostly consist of a more tightly braided cable and maybe an L-shaped jack or something, but the latter is more down to preference. Tuning The tuning of the T2 Plus is, as expected, very neutral sounding. The sub-bass does not extend as far as I would like, but that's more of a personal gripe than anything. The mids sound great on these, and the upper mids are tuned very pleasantly, seeming to be very natural and accurate sounding. The treble doesn't extend the furthest, but is decent enough to make the T2 Plus moderately exciting to listen to, with some extra detail brought to the forefront over other contenders in the same budget range. Strangely enough, these are not all that similar to the original T2. The bass extension seems to go a tad further than the original, with more emphasis on the midbass than the low mids where the original T2 seemingly tackles this the other way around. In addition, the upper mids feel a little more accurate on the T2 Plus, with more balance. The treble is also a little tamer on the T2 Plus, with a lower amplitude above 7kHz, and less extension overall. Overall, well tuned, moslty tonally accurate, and a good balance between detail and comfortable listening, though can be mildly cold sounding at times. 7/10 Value The T2 Plus is priced at around $60, which is a little above the majority of things presented here thus far. That being said, it performs well in the price bracket, probably being one of the most tonally accurate you can find, and having better detailing than a lot of alternatives. Additionally, it is one of the best of its kind in the sub-200 price bracket, being pretty close to neutral (if with a slightly warm tilt), which is uncommon in this budget range. Thus, I give the T2 Plus an 8/10 in value, simply for being the best of its kind you can get for the price, and still maintaining that achievement a little upwards of that. Summary Pleasantly tuned and neutral sounding, the tonality is almost spot on. Not for everyone, can be percieved as cold/anemic.
